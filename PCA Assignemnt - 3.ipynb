    "1. **Direction Preservation**: An eigenvector of a square matrix represents a direction in the vector space that remains unchanged in direction (i.e., preserved) when the matrix is applied as a linear transformation. In other words, if you have a vector \\(v\\) that is an eigenvector of a matrix \\(A\\), when \\(A\\) is applied to \\(v\\), the resulting vector will still be in the same direction as \\(v\\), though it may be scaled (stretched or compressed).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unit Length**: Eigenvectors are often normalized to have a length (magnitude) of 1 (unit vectors). This normalization simplifies the interpretation because the length of the eigenvector is preserved during the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Orthogonality**: Eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other. This orthogonality property is especially relevant in the context of symmetric (Hermitian) matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eigenvalues**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scaling Factor**: Eigenvalues are scalar values associated with eigenvectors. They represent the scaling factor by which the corresponding eigenvector is stretched or compressed when the matrix is applied as a linear transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Positive/Negative/Zero Eigenvalues**: \n",
    "   - If an eigenvalue is positive (\\(\\lambda > 0\\)), it indicates that the corresponding eigenvector is stretched.\n",
    "   - If an eigenvalue is negative (\\(\\lambda < 0\\)), it implies that the corresponding eigenvector is compressed or reflected.\n",
    "   - If an eigenvalue is zero (\\(\\lambda = 0\\)), it suggests that the corresponding eigenvector is a zero vector, and there is no stretching or compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric Interpretation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a 2D vector space for visualization. If you have a matrix \\(A\\) and an eigenvector \\(v\\) with an associated eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\), the geometric interpretation is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(v\\) represents a direction (an arrow) in the vector space.\n",
    "- When matrix \\(A\\) is applied to \\(v\\), the resulting vector is \\(Av\\).\n",
    "- If \\(\\lambda\\) is positive, \\(Av\\) will be a scaled version of \\(v\\), stretching it along the same direction.\n",
    "- If \\(\\lambda\\) is negative, \\(Av\\) will be a scaled and reversed version of \\(v\\), effectively compressing it and possibly changing its direction.\n",
    "- If \\(\\lambda\\) is zero, \\(Av\\) will be the zero vector, meaning that the transformation collapses the direction represented by \\(v\\) to the origin.\n",

    "1. **Distinct Eigenvalue-Eigenvector Pairs**: For a given square matrix, each distinct eigenvalue corresponds to a unique eigenvector (up to scalar multiples). That is, each eigenvalue is associated with its own linearly independent eigenvector. These distinct pairs represent different scaling factors and directions of the matrix's transformations.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Diagonalization**: The presence of distinct eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs allows the matrix to be diagonalized, which means it can be represented as a product of three matrices: \\(A = PDP^{-1}\\), where \\(P\\) is the matrix of eigenvectors, \\(D\\) is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, and \\(P^{-1}\\) is the inverse of the matrix of eigenvectors. This is a fundamental result of eigen decomposition.\n",
